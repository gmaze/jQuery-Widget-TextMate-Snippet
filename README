In a recent project I came to write a couple of jQuery UI widgets to build the user interface of a web API. 
I thus set up a clean jQuery UI widget snippet for my favorite text editor TextMate to easily create widgets. 
Note that you can easily modify the source code to create a template instead a of snippet.

Note:
The scope selector is source.js.jquery provided by the excellent jQuery TextMate bundle (by K. Swedberg and J. Chaffer, see https://github.com/kswedberg/jquery-tmbundle), but you could prefer source.js ...
